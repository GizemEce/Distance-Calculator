It calculates distance between two points either using Manhatten Distance or Euclidean Distance

#What is Euclidean Distance?
In mathematics, the Euclidean distance or Euclidean metric is the "ordinary" (i.e. straight-line) distance between 
two points in Euclidean space. With this distance, Euclidean space becomes a metric space. The associated norm is 
called the Euclidean norm. Older literature refers to the metric as Pythagorean metric. A generalized term for the
Euclidean norm is the L2 norm or L2 distance.

formula: dist((x, y), (a, b)) = √(x - a)² + (y - b)²

#What is Manhattan Distance?
The distance between two points in a grid based on a strictly horizontal and/or vertical path (that is, along the grid lines), 
as opposed to the diagonal or "as the crow flies" distance. The Manhattan distance is the simple sum of the horizontal and 
vertical components, whereas the diagonal distance might be computed by applying the Pythagorean theorem.


formula: dist((x, y), (a, b)) = |x - a| + |y - b|
